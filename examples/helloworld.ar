# Example 1: Fully qualified include
load system

external {
    system.console.writeln("Hello, world!")
}

# Example 2: Unqualified include of print function
#
# [LANG]: Architect offers no support for the "from module load *"
# pattern that exists in Python, unqualified includes must be explicit
from system.console load writeln

external {
    writeln("Hello, world!")
